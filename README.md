# FVM-Flat-Plate
Finite Volume Method applied to flow over a Flat plate in a mesh with refinement zones 


This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a 2D incompressible laminar flow solver for the flat plate problem using:

- Finite Volume Method
- SIMPLE algorithm for pressure–velocity coupling
- Rhie–Chow interpolation for collocated grids
- Gauss–Seidel iterative.

## Features

- Structured collocated mesh
- Face velocity interpolation (Rhie–Chow)
- Grid with refinement (Inflation Layers)
-  post-processing



## How to run

Run in Matlab or Octave BINF5_flatplate.m
